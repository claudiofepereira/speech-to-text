# Info:
- For now, can only use .mp4 and .wav files.

# To-Do:
- Make the program accept files as an argument.
- Implement a way to make paragraphs and dots in the text, where need be.
- Define a way to get the language of the audio automatically.
- Get the audio file size (in time) and check if the program needs to consider more than blocks of 45 seconds (max time is 60 seconds per request i believe). Sending requests of more than 60 seconds breaks the program for now. Consider changing API.
- The text is being saved in a dictionary ("text"), test out another ways of saving it.
- Try to use other types of video/audio files.

# Dreamy To-Do:
- Implement a way to reduce background noise.
- Make this program accessible as a webapp.
