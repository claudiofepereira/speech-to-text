00:00:00 final the mack it is when you were talking about Jason files one of the most if not the most popular format for data in the world especially extremely popular for web applications and that's because Jason comes from the most popular web language JavaScript JavaScript object notation
00:00:30 curly braces other stars around it there are double quotation marks
00:01:00 and a python dictionary the first and most important difference is something you have to remember whenever you deal with Jason and that he's the Jason is a string notice how this piece of cheese and here is inside a text file and what are the contents of text files that's all the contents of text strings as we saw when we read or CSV file when we read our plain old data file
00:01:30 finals text files always contain strings only when we read this if we be a string and we we converted into a python dictionary the second difference is that Jason must always use double quotation marks and not single quotation marks so if you do this which is perfectly valid in Python it would not be valid Jason so don't do that and some programs that read and write Json require
00:02:00 Debbie outermost element hear the outermost constructive structure be an object this thing here that we call a dictionary in Python is an object in JavaScript very similar
00:02:30 Sparkle friends Jason. EXT that is just this and this would be okay for some programs Andres orientation to your slight yellow and let me fix it real quick this would be okay for some programs but not others some have the requirement that the outermost structure be an object some do not have this requirement on this would be fine for our example we are going to stick with our
00:03:00 object Altima strut let's read some Jason using python module that you can important use called the Jason module we're going to talk a lot more about importing as we move on in this section we're going to be importing our own files and modules as well as system module but before we import
00:03:30 about importing the first thing I'm going to do is create a new file but I'm going to call something like Jason Imports important do not call the smile Jason become Jason module already existing python we're going to import it like so named after something that already
00:04:00 Easton python or do you try not to have a duplicate names for files and things like that just a general a piece of advice there a couple things and these things that other Developers
00:04:30 around turn a dictionary into Json data but it is a string and somebody wrote all the other building functions in Python like laying or some or even like things like print all of these have been written by someone
00:05:00 I'm they are made available to us to use globally in all our python files the only difference is that this Jason module is not included by default on all your files because whoever created python thought that it may not be necessary in all cases
00:05:30 so we've created a file that contains our friends as Jason and always how this is a friend and that is associated with a list and that contains three objects inside of it I'm going to try really hard to call these object when I'm talking about Jason and dictionaries weren't talking about python but please bear with me if I don't make any mistakes and these are objects in Json dictionary but only when we import them using the station module then we've the Jason
00:06:00 imported and now we have the ability to do things like Jason don't and access in pycharm or something else that we recommend function because we didn't have to create a new Json object but they are not inside
00:06:30 and indeed in point from you can go into the Jason module and my kitchen command click or consult click if you're on Windows and you can see the source code of the and module here you can see that a lot of it is is these comments that tell you how to use the functions but primarily there are some functions definitions like dumb and you can see the source code
00:07:00 and you can see the arguments and the source code and all the comments on everything there is just cold like the one we've right except we didn't write it but we can still important I noticed how as we go through the file these functions are at the lowest level of implantation they're on the very left which means they are not inside a class so as we import the Mojo we have access to those functions Direct
00:07:30 when it's in there but we're going to be using only a couple of functions in this video the first thing you need is a file pointer for that we're going to use the open function of course and we have to use an equal sign and we're going to open the friends on the call Jason. EST for reading so you know how to do that friend on this quotation. EXT in reading mode then we're going to load the contents way to do that is to do fine
00:08:00 example is Jason download of the file pointer to the load function inside the Jason module fixing a file pointer that is going to load the Jason from as fond of reading the file by the way this read the entire file it also turns it into a dictionary so now file contents is a dictionary and turns it to dictionary then and now
00:08:30 can use the file contents for whatever we want for example we can print file contents friends zero and that should print this dictionary here if you're using
00:09:00 I know you have it we print out the dictionary with name Jose and degree applied Computing that's why I studied at University this is how you load a Json file into a dictionary that you can then use as normal so he when accessing the friends key and then when accessing the zeroth element of the friends key if you want to do the opposite
00:09:30 also something you can do for example we are going to ride into a file called cars on the quotation so we're going to do cars equal this list here or dictionaries and by the way something I tend to do just because space after the dictionary and iPhone doesn't really like that I do that
00:10:00 I just wanted to be more readable and that's just because I do a lot of JavaScript and that's convention in JavaScript as well so now we have two dictionaries inside our list
00:10:30 see the contents into the file included how you going to say the content instead of Jason. Load you going to use Jason. Dumb so here's what you have to do go and investigate how to use Jason. Dump or a family just wait until after I asked you pause the video on your charge yourself for you
00:11:00 to go investigate how to use Jason dump and then save this list into a new file that you can call cars on the school Jason. EST I'll see you in a few seconds I hope you don't. If you did go well done by investigating you're going to learn faster
00:11:30 would be the official python documentation you could have gone into the Jason module with command click if you don't like or control click if your own windows and that you could have found this documentation here for the dump and function that it tells you what it does its serialized Tuesday
00:12:00 no I appreciate this is some lingo have we got here serializing means turning to a string FB is normally a file pointer and it tells you here but it has to be a file like object that allows you to do. Right but we've been doing without what we have to do
00:12:30 is open the file and write mode this time and then say Jason.. Cars or smile dog clothes that's wrong that doesn't need any new lines or spaces
00:13:00 I got all of these are completely optional just noticed how it's used double quotation marks as Nantes important even though we used single quotation mark no dictionaries python does not care for our strings whether we use double or single quotation marks but Jason does so it uses that if you had a string variable that you wanted to turn into a dictionary you can do that for example let's say my Jason
00:13:30 is something like this by the way I know very little about all this out the Romeo car that was released in 1950 and much later
00:14:00 dictionary you can do that but this time instead of using load that turns a Json file into a dictionary we can I use load ass for load string so incorrect car is going to be Jason don't load ass argument is a string or rather a switch and then you can print incorrect
00:14:30 ain't going back no name Dario then you can print that oh sorry it's so cold you have to access admin zero first my bad if you know he's not well done and there you have Alfa Romeo print it out pretty straightforward
00:15:00 example of that concern you know if you have if you have a dictionary like or do something like this one like this list or a dictionary you can use dump ass to turn whatever constructive thought into Jason Jason allow you to use lists and dictionaries it does not allow you to use couples so that's important to use lists and dictionaries.
00:15:30 feels like strings numbers floats and Eddy Jason Morgan will automatically call the rapper function the Thunder record function of your object if you choose to include any object in here generally though trying to avoid objects in a Jason just because when you load them up if you're going to be a string instrument really difficult so if you want to turn your objects into Jason which we will shortly make sure
00:16:00 you describe your objects using a dictionary for example you can make a dictionary out of the objects variable properties and their values that way you can then exported object to ask Jason string if you if you want if you don't know what I'm talking about that's fine we're going to be doing just that Jason later on in the course and even some of the things like that as well
00:16:30 so you can save them into files read them nicely and also so you can send them over the Internet popular thing to do with Jason and Jason are two very popular ways of storing data for sending the internet apps that persist data
00:17:00 sometimes in the next election we going to be creating a nice project but now I wanted to move on to a couple other things like importing our own files and our own modules just so you can start dividing your program into constituent part as opposed to having everything
00:17:30 twerk in a lower level it would be really important without said
