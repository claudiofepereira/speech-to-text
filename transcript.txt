00:00:00 I'm the one
00:00:30 oh my God
00:01:00 Boyd's stocks on the regular I don't play no games with you stop it for tonight
00:01:30 it ain't a project project and talk about being biracial bicoastal and platinum
00:02:00 moped with your window tinted green and make a name for you the next time for you
00:02:30 I don't want to pay my bills I need a hard-working woman with well everybody ain't made it yet. 5 degrees and six figures a day
00:03:00 get it done and get it done
